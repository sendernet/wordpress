== Description ==

= Introduction =

[Sender](https://www.sender.net/) is an all-in-one email & SMS marketing platform designed keeping the challenges of ecommerce and small businesses in mind.

Whether you are just starting to build your list or planning to scale and grow your business more, Sender gives you the perfect mix of capabilities to stay competitive.

Design dynamic popups and newsletter signup forms to attract interested prospects on the front while using the tool’s email and SMS features to nurture them through their buying journey.

= Run Marketing Automation Magic =

Marketing automation is the process of automating your email & SMS communication based on time-based or action-based triggers to convey the right message to your prospects at the right time.

Sender offers an array of prebuilt features to take the heavy lifting out of email marketing. Specifically, you can use Sender to send out the following email sequence types to your store prospects and customers:

* Abandoned cart recovery email
* Purchase order confirmation email
* Now back in stock notification email
* Win-back, Cross-sell, Reactivation email
* Feedback, Review request email
* Welcome email to new client

and many more.

Every type of email workflow, from one-time transactional emails to an ongoing drip campaign, is easy to implement using Sender.

= Send Beautiful Newsletters That Engage Readers =

A newsletter is an almost perfect way to stay in touch with both your fans and customers alike. While almost every email marketing tool out there features a way for you to compose and edit your email campaign, Sender goes a step further and includes features that make it your go-to newsletter plugin for wordpress.

Email newsletter design from scratch is a breeze with the drag-and-drop email builder. If you don’t have much time to design your email, Sender includes a free email templates library from which you can simply import a premade, high-converting template in a single click.

Sending out a promotional email for your online store? Use the 1-click product import feature to import all details, including the product image, pricing, and description in one shot inside your email.

While setting up email campaigns is easy and straightforward, the primary benefit of using Sender for your newsletter marketing is the high-reputation infrastructure that promises high deliverability. This means that you will often land inside your prospects’ inboxes rather than the Promotions tab or Spam folder, ensuring higher chances of being read.

= Growing a List of Fans =

Grow your list of subscribers effortlessly without needing a dedicated email designer. Sender’s super simple popup and newsletter signup form builder helps you create custom, branded designs, even if you’ve never done this before.

Sender offers you a variety of FREE premade layouts as part of the templates library to enable you to design your own responsive newsletter form or ecommerce popup in no time.

Whether you are looking for a simple, mobile-friendly, embeddable newsletter signup form or a fancy exit intent popup, making your own from scratch is equally easy with straightforward drag-and-drop actions.

= Laser-Targeted Messaging =

Your emails are more likely to be responded to, and acted upon when they are personalized and extremely relevant to the reader.

Sender helps you customize your email components, such as the subject line, preview text header, and the email body using common data points such as first names, locations, or custom user info collected using the forms before.

On the other hand, dumping every single email as a broadcast to your entire list is a deadly mistake. Segment your prospects into groups based on common characteristics (for e.g. customers vs prospects) so you are delivering relevant offers to each group at all times.

= Leveraging the Text Message (SMS) =

While your [email automation](https://www.sender.net/email-automation/) is all set to deliver that abandoned cart email to abandoning visitors or that completed new order email to every buying customer, SMS notifications have their own place.

After all, over [90% of text messages are read and responded to inside of 3 minutes.](https://www.sender.net/sms-open-rates/)

Sender helps you easily compose and send personalized text messages to prospects and customers at scale, developing deeper relationships with them.

To ensure the best user experience at all times, while also striving to make your business look good, Sender strictly adheres to stringent standards such as GDPR and TCPA.

Sender’s infrastructure chooses the best SMS routes at all times to ensure reliable and timely sending of your business text messages worldwide.

= One-Stop Email & SMS Dashboard =

Sender helps you manage your email marketing and SMS messaging from the same dashboard without switching between tabs or using third-party software to help automate controls.

While prepaid text messaging already comes at extremely affordable rates, subscribing to the Professional plan ensures that you get FREE SMS credits equal in value to your plan amount every month.

= Advanced Reporting Capabilities =

Sender offers both basic and advanced reporting capabilities for your email and SMS campaigns. You can monitor:

* Sales reports
* Email and SMS performance reports
* Individual subscriber activity, and more

What’s more, you can even view the performance of your email newsletter vis-a-vis the recipient’s geographical location.

= Amazing 24/7 Live Support =

Sender’s platform is simple and straightforward to use for both new and experienced users alike.

However, should you feel the need to ask a quick question or have an advanced scenario you need expert help with, you have easy access to:

* 24-by-7 Live Chat Support
