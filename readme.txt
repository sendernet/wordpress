== Description ==

Sender.net is an email marketing platform tailored for smaller businesses and e-commerce ventures. Sender is highly dedicated to delivering the best user experience possible and includes features for process automation and boosting email response rates. Our users can create beautiful and optimized emails up to 2 times faster.

Sender has a “Free Forever” plan that aims to help out new businesses and e-commerce websites: 

 * Up to 2500 subscribers per month
 * Up to 15 000 emails per month

Make sending targeted emails simple by integrating Sender into WordPress. Instead of relying on third-party dashboards, you will be able to send any automated emails right from your page such as:

 * Abandoned cart emails
 * Welcome emails
 * Onboarding emails
 * Order confirmation emails
 * Shipping information emails
 * Any other event-based emails

There are additional features available after joining Sender and integrating our plugin into WordPress. Sender automatically retrieves important data from your website or e-commerce platform, allowing you to:

 * Manage client profiles and data.
 * Create email campaigns.
 * Use our Drag & Drop email builder.
 * Create newsletter signup forms and pop-ups.
 * Send promotional offers and newsletters.

All features available on Sender are accessible and easy to use even for those without any technical experience.
