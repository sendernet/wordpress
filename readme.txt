Make sending targeted emails simple by integrating Sender into WordPress.

 * Abandoned cart emails
 * Welcome emails
 * Onboarding emails

 * Shipping information emails
 * Any other event-based emails

There are additional [features](https://www.sender.net/features/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=link) available after joining Sender and integrating our plugin into WordPress. Our plugin retrieves important data from your website or e-commerce platform, allowing you to:

 * Manage client profiles and data.
 * Create email campaigns.
 * [Use our Drag & Drop email builder.](https://www.sender.net/create-emails/)
 * [Create newsletter signup forms and pop-ups.](https://www.sender.net/audience/)
